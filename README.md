This repository holds code for various projects that I've worked on both in school and on my own time.

### Laptop Regression
This folder holds a (currently incomplete) linear regression model that focuses on price data for various laptops. The price is the independent variable, and the dependent variables incldue features such as size and storage. The model is primariliy designed for interpretive purposes and is carried out over multiple Jupyter documents. The first preprocesses the data and saves it, and the subsequent files perform the regression and make sure the approprate assumtions are met.

### Sports Analytics
This folder holds a college group project that focused on atheletes and contained multiple predefined tasks which were split among my teammates and I. These include things such as basic preprocessing of the data, finding means and other metrics, and generating plots.
