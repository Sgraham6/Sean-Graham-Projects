This repository holds code for various projects that I've worked on both in school and on my own time.

### Laptop Regression
This folder holds a (currently incomplete) linear regression model that focuses on price data (obtained from Kaggle) for various laptops. The price is the independent variable, and the dependent variables incldue features such as size and storage. The model is primarily designed for interpretive purposes and is carried out over multiple Jupyter documents. The first preprocesses the data and saves it, and the subsequent files perform the regression and make sure the approprate assumtions are met.

### Sports Analytics
This folder holds a college group project that focused on athletes and contained multiple predefined tasks which were split by me and my teammates. These include things such as basic preprocessing of the data, finding means and other metrics, and generating plots.

### Text Mining
This folder holds files from an 8 week college class on text mining in fall 2022. One folder holds the weekly exercises for the first 7 weeks, one holds the files for the final project in week 8 (which includes a PowerPoint presentation and script that were presented to the class), and the last holds the datasets that were used by the previous two.

### Deep Learning
This folder holds files from an 8 week college class on deep learning in spring 2022. One folder holds six projects completed over the first 7 weeks, one holds the files for the final project (which includes a PowerPoint presentation and script that were presented to the class), and the last holds the datasets that were used by the previous two. It should be noted the that "Final Project Part 1" file had to have its outputs cleared, as it would be too large to display otherwise.
